Intro
==========
It is a fully feature client and server-side routing
library for react.

Helps create and navigate between different URLs that
make up your web application.

Provides unique URLs for differnt components in the app 
and make the UI easily shareable with other users.

Installation
===============
To install react router 6 for this application 
npm install react-router-dom@6

Configuring routes with react router
=====================================
1) connect the URL in the browser with the react application.
   For that, react router provide a component called browserRouter
   with which we need to wrap our entire app.

  This will allow us to use all the features from react 
  router within the app component tree.

Routes --> Within this component, we define the individual 
           route using the Route component 

          On Route component, we specify two props :-
          1) path -> which reflect the path in the URL.
          2) element -> what is the element need to be render when the URL matches the path.



Link
-> Routing to different routes using an element in the UI.
-> To navigate to another route, react router provides 
   us with the link component
-> Link element renders an anchor element in the DOM. But instead of href
   attribute, we pass 'to' as props and specify the path for the configured route.
