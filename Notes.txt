It is a fully feature client and server-side routing
library for react.

Helps create and navigate between different URLs that
make up your web application.

Provides unique URLs for differnt components in the app 
and make the UI easily shareable with other users.

Configuring routes with react router
1) connect the URL in the browser with the react application.
   For that, react router provide a component called browserRouter
   with which we need to wrap our entire app.

  This will allow us to use all the features from react 
  router within the app component tree.

Routes --> Within this component, we define the individual 
           route using the Route component 

          On Route component, we specify two props :-
          1) path -> which reflect the path in the URL.
          2) element -> what is the element need to be render when the URL matches the path.
